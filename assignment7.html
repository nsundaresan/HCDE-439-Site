            <h1>Assignment 7: Computer Control!</h1>
            <p>"Create a webpage with p5.js that interacts with your arduino.
              By doing things with your keyboard and mouse, things must change in
              the real world! Vice versa, by doing things on your arduino, the p5
              page must also change. You must use JSON parsing, Serial, and p5.js.
              Your webpage must be interactive. You must use a minimum of two input
              devices from the arduino (e.g. LDR and Thermistor) and a minimum of
              one output device from the arduino, one of which you control with a
              transistor (e.g. led strip or DC motor)."</p>

            <strong><p>Circuit demo:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="Assignment7Images/gif.gif" width=500></a></p>
            <p>This is a gif showing how the system works. The LDR and button change the heights of the two bars on the page,
              and any key pressed on my laptop changes the brightness of my LED strip based off it's ASCII value.</p>

            <p>Here are some images of how the circuit looks assembled:</p>

            <strong><p>Schematic:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="Assignment7Images/5.jpg" width=500></a></p>
            <p>This is a schematic of my circuit.</p>
          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Calculations:</p></strong>
            <p>I chose to use a 10k ohm resistor for my button, photoresistor, and LED strip because
            it will properly ensure the components are grounded. It is a safe choice for this circuit.
            Other than that, there were no other real calculations. The values were translated from
            the keyboard to the LED strip by determining their ASCII value.</p>
          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Code Snippet:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="Assignment7Images/arduinocode.png" width=800></a></p>
            <p>Above is the code that is programmed into the arduino.</p>

            <p><img src="Assignment7Images/jscode2.png" width=800></a></p>
            <p>Above is the code that is programmed into the browser to take serial values from the
              arduino and display them as a graph, as well as communicate key pressed values to the arduino
            to change the LED brightness.</p>
