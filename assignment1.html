            <h1>Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
            <p>"Create a schematic for at least 3 LEDs connected to your Arduino, which you will implement as a
              circuit on your breadboard. You will write firmware (in a .ino file) for the circuit that makes the LEDs
              blink in a pattern."

            <p>This is a schematic going into more detail about the parts of the circuits. To keep it simple, I decided to
            make three different circuits, each with one resistor and one LED. This way, there won't be any overload
            on the LED or the resistor.</p>

            <p><img src="Assignment1Images/codesnippet.png" width=500></a></p>
            <p>The code makes sure the lights are individually programmable, as well as coordinates the flashing of
              the lights.</p>
