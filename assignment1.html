            Hi! My name is Nitya Nandini Sundaresan, but I go by Nanda. I am currently a junior at UW
            studying HCDE and pursuing a minor in Informatics. I am aiming to become a UX/UI Designer
            upon graduation. I am currently an intern at a local startup designing user experiences for an
            AI based product--which is super fun and a good challege.

            In my free time I like to paint (watercolor and acrylic), and row on Lake Sammamish when it's nice out.

            I am excited to see what we're going to do in this class, and learn some new skills.
