              over serial. You must use Serial.print and p5.js. Your webpage must be interactive."</p>

            <strong><p>Schematic:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="Assignment6Images/IMG_1970.JPG" width=500></a></p>
            <p>This is a schematic of my circuit.</p>
          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Calculations:</p></strong>
            <p>There were not many calculations I had to do as there were no resistors involved in this circuit.
              However, I did map my values from the joystick to display. I mapped values 0-1023 from the joystick
              to a range of 0-255 so changes are better translated in the interactive display.</p>

            <p>This is the code that is programmed into the arduino.</p>
            <p><img src="Assignment6Images/jscode.png" width=800></a></p>
            <p>This is the code that is programmed into the browser to take serial values from the
              arduino and display them as a graph.</p>
