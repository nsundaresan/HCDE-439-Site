            <h1>Assignment 3: Input Output!</h1>
            <p>"Create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a sensor (e.g. either the photoresistor or the thermistor)
              in a voltage divider to change the state of an LED. Your schematic description should explain the values chosen.
              You have to use analogRead(), analogWrite(), the map function, and an if-statement in your code."

            <strong><p>Schematic:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="Assignment3Images/IMG_1895.jpg" width=500></a></p>
            <p>This is a schematic of my circuit. Calculations and justifications for resistor choices are
            described below:</p>
          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Math:</p></strong>
            <p>To choose the correct resistor for the red LED, I used Ohm's law.</p>
          </br>
            <p>V = IR</p>
            <p>Known variables: I = 30mA (limited by the LED), V = 5V (total voltage) - 1.8V (voltage drop of LED)</p>
            <p>R = V / I </p>
            <p>R = ~107 Ohms</p>
            <p>I chose to use the 220 Ohm resistor since it is the one with the closest value to 106. For the photoresistor, I used a 10k ohm resistor
            to make sure the current was fully grounded when the switch is off.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Values I might read at the voltage breaker might include:</p>

          </br>
          </br>
            <strong><p>Code Snippet:</p></strong>
            <p><img src="Assignment3Images/codesnippet.png" width=800></a></p>
            <p>To satisfy all the conditions of the assignment, I decided to use analogRead() to get the condition of the photoresistor's current state.
            I used analogWrite() to initialize the LED at a brightness of around 80%. The map function was used to translate photoresistor states to
            LED brightness values from 0-255. Lastly, I used an if statement to change what is printed in the serial
            monitor.</p>
